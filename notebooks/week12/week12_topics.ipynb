    "  - By tonight (midnight) for Assignment 6b in {ref}`assignments`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - save your notebook in a301_lib.data_share, with your name and \"assign6b\"\n",
    "      in the file name (no spaces).  It does not matter what folder below data_share you\n",
    "      put it in, as long as I can find it with `.glob(\"**/*assign6b*\")`.\n",
    "      I'll log in as you and run the notebook from that folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Read {ref}`notes_on_radar` along with Stull pages 245-248 for {ref}`assign6c` and come\n",
    "    prepared to talk about the discussion questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Why does the returned power decrease as $1/R^2$ and not the roundtrip spreading of $1/R^4$ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) We have \"hardwired\" in a wavelength of 10 cm, a beam width of 0.95 deg, etc.\n",
    "       which is specific to the WSR-88D radar.  We\n",
    "       are also assuming that we are using the same antenna to receive and to transmit\n",
    "\n",
    "    3) Transmitted power is 750,000 Watts, Received power can be as low as $10^{-15}$ Watts\n",
    "  \n",
    "    4) Suppose you are given $Z_1$ in $mm^6\\,m^{-3}$, c in m/s,\n",
    "       $\\Delta t$ in s and $\\lambda$ in cm.  How do you convert\n",
    "       $Z_1 c  \\Delta t/\\lambda^2$ to $km^2$?\n",
    "\n",
    "    5) The reflectivity goes down as b and K increase and goes up as\n",
    "       $L_a$ and R increase -- explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6) Why is the width of the radar sample volume proportional to $\\Delta t/2$\n",
    "       instead of $\\Delta t$ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Go over the radar equation (Stull 8.28, p. 246)\n",
